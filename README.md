```bash
pip install -e .
```



### From GPT
To build a machine learning model for detecting real vs. deepfake videos, follow these steps:

1. Preprocessing Techniques
Since MP4 files contain both audio and video, you need to decide whether to use:

Video Only

Audio Only

Both (Multimodal Approach)

Video Preprocessing
Frame Extraction: Extract frames from the video at a fixed rate (e.g., 1 frame per second) using OpenCV or FFmpeg.

Face Detection: Use a pre-trained face detection model (e.g., MTCNN, RetinaFace) to crop faces.

Data Augmentation: Apply transformations like rotation, flipping, and color jitter to prevent overfitting.

Optical Flow Analysis: Capture motion inconsistencies in fake videos.

Deep Feature Extraction: Use pre-trained CNNs (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet) to extract features from face regions.

Audio Preprocessing (if applicable)
Mel-Spectrograms: Convert audio into spectrograms for deep learning models.

Voice Feature Extraction: Use MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) to analyze voice properties.

Speech Embeddings: Use models like wav2vec 2.0 for deep feature extraction.

2. Model Selection
The best models for deepfake detection are:

CNNs (e.g., EfficientNet, Xception, ResNet50) – Good for single-frame analysis.

LSTMs/Transformers (e.g., TimeSformer, ViViT) – Good for temporal dependencies.

Hybrid Models (CNN + LSTM or CNN + Transformer) – Useful for both spatial and temporal features.

Vision Transformers (ViT, Swin Transformer) – Can learn spatial and contextual relationships better.

For multimodal approaches, use:

Fusion Models (e.g., Audio + Video models with late fusion techniques)

Multimodal Transformers (e.g., CLIP, MMF)

3. Training and Evaluation
Dataset Splitting: Use a 70-20-10 split (train-validation-test).

Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy for classification.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC.

Explainability: Use Grad-CAM to visualize CNN attention.

4. Real-World Considerations
Generalization: Train on diverse datasets to avoid overfitting to specific deepfake generators.

Adversarial Training: Use GAN-generated deepfakes to improve robustness.

Real-time Inference: Optimize for speed using TensorRT or ONNX.

Do you have a preferred dataset format or are you collecting the deepfake samples yourself?
